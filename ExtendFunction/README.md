# Apteco PS Modules - PowerShell functions extension

This module can be used to extend existing functions/cmdlets with more scripting
and possibly additional parameters like

```PowerShell
function Invoke-CoreWebRequest {
    
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true)][string]$AdditionalString
    )
    DynamicParam { Get-BaseParameters "Invoke-WebRequest" }

    Process {
        Write-Host $AdditionalString
        $updatedParameters = Skip-UnallowedBaseParameters -Base "Invoke-WebRequest" -Parameters $PSBoundParameters
        Invoke-WebRequest @updatedParameters
    }

}
```

```PowerShell
Find-Module -Repository "PSGallery" -Tag "Apteco"
```

### Installation via local Repository

If your machine does not have an online connection you can use another machine to save the script from PSGallery website as a local file via your browser. You should have download a file with an `.nupkg` extension. Please don't forget to download all dependencies, too. You could simply unzip the file(s) and put the script somewhere you need it OR do it in an updatable manner and create a local repository if you don't have it already with

```PowerShell
Set-Location "$( $env:USERPROFILE )\Downloads"
New-Item -Name "PSRepo" -ItemType Directory
Register-PSRepository -Name "LocalRepo" -SourceLocation "$( $env:USERPROFILE )\Downloads\PSRepo"
Get-PSRepository
```

On Linux you would use `Set-Location "$( $env:Home )/Downloads"` or create the `.\Downloads` directory.

Then put your downloaded `.nupkg` file into the new created `PSRepo` folder and you should see the module via 

```PowerShell
Find-Module -Repository LocalRepo
```

Then install the script like 

```PowerShell
Find-Module -Repository LocalRepo -Name ExtendFunction -IncludeDependencies | Install-Module -Scope CurrentUser -Verbose
```

That way you can exchange the `.nupkg` files and update them manually from time to time.

### Uninstall

If you don't want to use the script anymore, just remove it with 

```PowerShell
Uninstall-Module -Name ExtendFunction
```

## Github
